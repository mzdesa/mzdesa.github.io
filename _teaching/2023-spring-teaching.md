I was a TA in the two-semester undergraduate & masters robotics course at UC Berkeley. In part A of the course (Fall 2022), I taught weekly discussion sections on classical topics in robotics, ranging from transformation groups & exponential maps to forward & inverse kinematics and computer vision. Here, I wrote a set of course notes on robot kinematics to supplement the course lectures. 

In part B of the course (Spring 2023), I taught weekly discussion sections on introductory nonlinear control, nonholonomic planning, and optimization-based control. Here, I wrote bi-weekly assignments consisting both of theoretical and computational questions. Additionally, I created a new hardware & software lab on safety-critical control for multi-agent systems. In simulation, students were tasked with designing control barrier function-based controllers for swarms of robots to avoid collisions with one another. Then, students were tasked with implementing their controllers on hardware on the Turtlebot platform, using lidar sensors to detect obstacles. In this course, I also wrote a set of notes, introducing the basic concepts of nonlinear control, planning, and estimation to students at the advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate level.
