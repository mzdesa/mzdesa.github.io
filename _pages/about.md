Hi, I'm Max! I'm a PhD student in Control & Dynamical Systems (CDS) at Caltech, within the department of Computing and Mathematical Sciences. I'm advised by Professor Aaron D. Ames. My main research interests lie in applications of geometry & topology (among other fields of mathematics) to modern problems in systems & control theory. Within this theme, I'm particularly interested in safety-critical and architectural aspects of control. 

Previously, I was an undergraduate at UC Berkeley, where I obtained a B.S. in mechanical engineering & a minor in mathematics. At Berkeley, I was fortunate to work with Professor Koushil Sreenath on quadrotor control.
