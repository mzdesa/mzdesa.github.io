I was a TA for the electronics course required for undergraduate mechanical engineers. Each week, I would hold a total of six hours of lab sections, one hour of discussion section, and one hour of office hours. In lab sections, we focused on the fundamentals of practical electronics for mechanical engineers. Labs ranged from topics such as embedded programming in Python (for the ESP32 microcontroller), circuit design and debugging (including an introduction to soldering and oscilloscope use), interfacing with sensors and power sources (e.g solar panels and current sensors), and the internet of things (e.g. design of web apps interfacing with microcontrollers). In discussion sections, I would review course content on material such as python programming, basic circuit analysis (e.g. KCL & KVL analysis, Thevenin & Norton equivalent circuits), transistors & diodes, amplifiers, and digital logic. To accompany these weekly discussion sections, I wrote a set of comprehensive course notes on introductory programming and circuit analysis.

This was the first time I was a TA for a course, and I found that I thoroughly enjoyed the process.
