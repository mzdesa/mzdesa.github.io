Hi, I'm Max! I'm a PhD student in Control & Dynamical Systems (CDS) at Caltech, within the department of Computing and Mathematical Sciences. I'm advised by Professor Aaron D. Ames. My main research interests lie in applications of geometry & topology to modern problems in control & systems theory, with an emphasis on safety-critical control. Previously, I was an undergraduate at UC Berkeley, where I was fortunate to work with Professor Koushil Sreenath on quadrotor control.
